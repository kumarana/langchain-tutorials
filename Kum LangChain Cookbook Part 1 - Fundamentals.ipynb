    "### **What is LangChain?**\n",
    "> LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**~~TL~~DR**: LangChain makes the complicated parts of working & building with AI models easier. It helps do this in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integration** - Bring external data, such as your files, other applications, and api data, to your LLMs\n",
    "2. **Agency** - Allow your LLMs to interact with it's environment via decision making. Use LLMs to help decide which action to take next\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why LangChain?**\n",
    "1. **Components** - LangChain makes it easy to swap out abstractions and components necessary to work with language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Customized Chains** - LangChain provides out of the box support for using and customizing 'chains' - a series of actions strung together.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Speed üö¢** - This team ships insanely fast. You'll be up to date with the latest LLM features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Community üë•** - Wonderful discord and community support, meet ups, hackathons, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though LLMs can be straightforward (text-in, text-out) you'll quickly run into friction points that LangChain helps with once you develop more complicated applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: This cookbook will not cover all aspects of LangChain. It's contents have been curated to get you to building & impact as quick as possible. For more, please check out [LangChain Conceptual Documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/)*"

      "\" In this episode of Saturday Architecture, Prime Video releases a video on how they move from microservices to monolith architecture, and the internet is debating if this is a good idea. According to the video, it enabled them to save 90% cost.\n",
      "\n",
      " This set-up has three modules; one to acquire data, one to detect defects, and one to fix them. Each of these modules were in three different microservices, and each had a cost associated with it which caused account-limits when trying to capture and store individual frames.\n",
      "\n",
      " In this section, the discussion focuses on the need for a handoff between process and data, as well as the costly workflow involved. A monolith approach is mentioned, where all three processes are done by one single instance, resulting in more efficient workflow and reducing costs.\n",
      "\n",
      " In this case, it is evident that the way the cost issues have been approached should have worked, as it has been established in the real-time data acquisition and processing industry that data acquirers and processors should be separated. However, it didn't work in this instance, so the speaker wants to know what the listener thinks.\n",
      "\n",
      " This section discusses the use of design patterns and standards to create efficient architectures that don't have to continuously reinvent the wheel. The concrete example given is that of a real-time streaming data acquirer and separate process, which is said to be a good architecture decision.\n",
      "\n",
      " In hindsight, it is clear that the decision was wrong. However, how to prevent the same mistake from being made in the future is discussed. The speaker suggests the importance of taking appropriate action and learning from errors in order to effectively mitigate damage.\n",
      "\n",
      " The speaker advocates for preventative measures to be taken while problem-solving for greater efficiency. Design patterns play an important role in this, but the speaker warns that it is not always possible to avoid pitfalls.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Problem solving should be the focus and not the methodology when approaching issues. This includes questioning the assumptions of the architecture and how micro services are executed.\n",
      "\n",
      " The speaker is posing questions about who is making the micro services and how many separate teams there are. They also recognize the need for collaboration between teams to ensure success and progress.\n",
      "\n",
      " There are structures and teams which can be analyzed to determine if microservices are necessary. For example, if one team is working on three microservices, it should be examined to see if all three should be combined into one. This is just an indication and not always the case.\n",
      "\n",
      " It is important to consider whether one service making up three microservices would be more efficient, as the same team may not be available due to the lack of resources.\n",
      "\n",
      " This is discussing services from a capability perspective, emphasizing the overhead involved in transferring data frames. There is a technical and monetary cost associated with this overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      " This passage discusses the concept of work study, which is a formal study of behavior that has existed for more than a century related to production engineering, industrial engineering, and mechanical engineering. It suggests that there may be some way to detect this kind of behavior related to micro services when talking about them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This excerpt discusses a type of research called human motion study, which involves breaking down tasks into parts in order to find the most effective and economical motion. It also looks at the tools used and how they are stored for the workman.\n",
      "\n",
      " In this case, the analogy exists for software architects interested in work study, to understand the economy of motion, and how to move with minimum effort to get the tools they need to do their job.\n",
      "\n",
      " A suggestion has been made that somebody in technology learn from production, engineering and manufacturing experts to better understand how to bring things together or break them apart. It is also advised that mechanical and manufacturing industries should be considered when deciding what to keep and what to break.\n",
      "\n",
      " The speaker suggests we can use the mature manufacturing industry and the information technology revolution to inform the design of better micro services.\n",
